My name is Luke Wileczek and I am currently a Data Scientist working in McLean, Virgina.  

### More Information

I graduated from Virginia Tech in 2017 (*go Hokies*) with a degree in Mathematics.  DId not start programming until I started working in July and I am slowly starting to like it. I have a long journey ahead of me, which is the best part.  To lazy to make a [travel blog](nicholelynnwheeler.wixsite.com/travelblog) so I will borrow my girlfriends.
