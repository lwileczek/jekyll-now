My name is Luke Wileczek and I am currently a Data Scientist working in McLean, Virgina.  

### More Information

I graduated from Virginia Tech in 2017 (*go Hokies*) with a degree in Mathematics.  I started programming when I started my job in July 2017 and I am slowly starting to like it. I have a long journey ahead of me, which is the best part. I'd love to hear some real nerdy talk so if you have something for me to research or do please reach out to me at my email below.  To lazy to make a [travel blog](https://nicholelynnwheeler.wixsite.com/travelblog) so I will borrow my girlfriends.
