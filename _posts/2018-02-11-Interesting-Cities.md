# Interesting Cities
Growing up I moved around and got used to change. I lived in Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Virginia.
I can see myself going many places over my life and decided I should start looking for places to visit and live.  
Although I am pretty open to living almost anywhere, it's prudent to start doing some research and compiling a priority list.
I am currently living in Arlington Virgina, just outside of Washington D.C.

## Breakdown

### Denver

I recently had two friends move here and they cannot stop telling me about it.  They insist I come vist and believe I will love it. 
Known as a hub for outdoor lovers, Denver is a beautiful city sitting just outside the Rocky Mountains. 
In addition to the beautiful landscape there seem to be a lot of tech jobs. My first time crossing the Mississippi was in January 2018
and my bredth was taken away by the mountains. I haven't personally been to Denvor yet but I will have to make a trip to soon to see
my friends and evaluate the city. 

### Charlotte

I went to Charlotte with a group of friends in the fall of 2016 and fell in love. The entire town looked new, like it had all been
built that year. There were large buildings and a fast passed atomosphere on friday, but on the weekend it seemed calm with plenty of
breweries around to visit and other things to do.  Charlotte is only a three hour drive to my alma mater Virginia Tech which means
I would be able to go back easily for a football game, a huge plus!

### Nashville

Big music city with a lot going on. I don't know a single person who as lived or visited Nashville and didn't love it.
### Boston

Historic and beautiful, Boston has a certain charm about it I cannot get away from. 
### Chicago

Third biggest city in the US, and on top of lake Michigan. This is the biggest city on my list. Winter can be scary but the fall
and spring are to die for. Chicago is another city that doesn't sleep so there is always something to do. I lived in west Michigan for seven years and will always have a soft spot for the mid-west. 
### Salt Lake City

I have never been to Salt Lake, just a layover en rout  toMontana. However, when the plane touched down between the giant mountains that 
surround the city I couldn't believe my eyes. 
### Pittsburgh

Beautiful and clean. Passionate sports fans. 
### Baltimore

I went to visit my cousin recently who lives in Fed Hill. Beautiful place with a lot going on. Cheaper than DC.
