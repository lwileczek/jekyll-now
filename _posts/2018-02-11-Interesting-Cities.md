# Interesting Cities
Growing up I moved around and a few times and got used to change. I lived in Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Virginia.
I can see myself going many places over my life and decided I should start looking for places to visit and live.  
Although I am pretty open to living almost anywhere, it's prudent to start doing some research and compiling a priority list.
I am currently living in Arlington Virgina, just outside of Washington D.C.

## Breakdown

### Denver

I recently had two friends move here and they cannot stop telling me about it.  They insist I come vist and believe I will love it. 
Known as a hub for outdoor lovers, Denver is a beautiful city sitting just outside the Rocky Mountains. 
In addition to the beautiful landscape there seem to be a lot of tech jobs. My first time crossing the Mississippi was in January 2018
and my bredth was taken away by the mountains. I haven't personally been to Denvor yet but I will have to make a trip to soon to see
my friends and evaluate the city. 

### Charlotte

I went to Charlotte with a group of friends in the fall of 2016 and fell in love. The entire town looked new, like it had all been
built that year. There were large buildings and a fast passed atomosphere on friday, but on the weekend it seemed calm with plenty of
breweries around to visit and other things to do.  Charlotte is only a three hour drive to my alma mater Virginia Tech which means
I would be able to go back easily for a football game, a huge plus!
