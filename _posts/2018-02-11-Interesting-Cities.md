Growing up I moved around and got used to change. I lived in Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Virginia.
I can see myself going many places over my life and decided I should start looking for places to visit and live.  
Although I am open to living almost anywhere, it's prudent to start doing some research and compiling a priority list.
I am currently living in Arlington Virginia, just outside of Washington D.C.

## Breakdown

### Denver

I recently had two friends move here and they cannot stop telling me about it.  They insist I come visit and believe I will love it. 
Known as a hub for outdoor lovers, Denver is a beautiful city sitting just outside the Rocky Mountains. 
In addition to the beautiful landscape there seem to be a lot of tech jobs. My first time crossing the Mississippi was in January 2018
and my breadth was taken away by the mountains. I haven't personally been to Denver yet but I will have to make a trip to soon to see
my friends and evaluate the city.

### Charlotte

I went to Charlotte with a group of friends in the fall of 2016 and fell in love. The entire town looked new, like it had all been
built that year. There were large buildings and a fast-paced atmosphere on Friday, but on the weekend, it seemed calm with plenty of
breweries around to visit and other things to do.  Charlotte is only a three-hour drive to my alma mater Virginia Tech which means
I would be able to go back easily for a football game, a huge plus! 

### Nashville

Through the years dozens of people have brought up Nashville in conversation unprovoked just raving about their love for the city.  All I hear is how there is so much going on, how beautiful it is, and how happy people are.  I have yet to make the journey myself, but I know they have big time football and hockey which always help bring a city together. The music scene speaks for itself here, which means endless entertainment whenever desired.  Maybe it's time I get myself a pair of them cowboy boots and indulge in some southern comfort food.

### Boston

Historic and beautiful, Boston has a certain charm about it I cannot get away from.  My family went to visit Boston when I was still in high school and I never forgot how awestruck I felt when I was there.  Being one of the U.S.'s oldest cities, it has a huge economy with a large mix of both large conglomerates and small startups scattered around. Living in Boston gives its inhabitance quick access to the Vermont mountains and the sea.

### Chicago

On lake Michigan, this beautiful and vast city has everything to offer, except an airport with on time flights.  Living in west Michigan for seven years gave a soft spot for the mid-west.  Being the third largest city in America, Chicago has everything in the world to offer, including being close to my sister who lives in Kalamazoo Michigan.  
### Salt Lake City

I have never been to Salt Lake, just a layover en route to Montana.  However, when the plane touched down between the giant mountains that surround the city I couldn't believe my eyes.  The mountains are beautiful, and it would definitely bring some change to my life. 

### Pittsburgh

I went to Pittsburgh a few times when back I lived in Warren Pennsylvannia for a year.  The city seemed clean and well put together. It is cheaper than Washington D.C., although most places are, which is a major plus. I don't have many reasons drawing me here other than I had fun the few times when I frequented in the past.

### Baltimore

I went to visit my cousin recently who lives in Fed Hill.  It was nice to walk around the Harbor and there are plenty of bars and tap houses everywhere. I found the prices to be far cheaper than D.C. which is pretty easy to beat and it is close to home. My parents are live just out side of Philadelphia, so getting home would be a cinch!
